### How to use
1. Fork this or clone this.
2. Change the name, description and repo links
3. Code your magic in the `/src` directory
4. Test, if necessary: it's all set up already.
5. `yarn build`
6. To test this in development, without publishing, use `yarn link`. In another project, you then can `yarn link "your_package_name"`
7. `npm publish` :) Now you have published your very own package!
